				When you consider how far we’ve come over 40 years… the communities… the technology… <br>the service… the people… the experience… all that we have done that we are very proud of… <br>it’s just a little insight into what the next 40 years is going to look like.”

				Our craftsmanship and quality start from the very first design concept and go all the way through to every single tradesperson and supplier who walk through the door. We believe there is much more to buying a new home than just handing over a set of keys. There is a process that goes with it that is very individualized, very personal and that can only be delivered by a first-class team of customer care specialists, who work closely with purchasers to keep them fully informed, from the first time they walk through the sales office door to months and years after they’ve moved into their new home. Built on a solid reputation of quality, integrity and service, Reid’s Heritage Homes is one of Ontario’s leading builders. For over 40 years, we have proudly developed homes ranging from single detached homes, mid-rise condos, two-storey, executive and bungalow townhomes, to custom estates and active adult communities. Our dedication to our values and traditions has established us as an award-winning developer with hundreds of awards and accolades.

				Our purchasers can be very confident in Reid’s Heritage Homes delivering the very highest level of design, construction and customer service. That’s demonstrated through our history, and our 40-year track record of offering consistent quality, generation after generation. We have customers who purchased from us and then who have purchased from us again. Their children have purchased from us, and their children’s children. That’s very exciting for us, and it’s a testament to the assurance that the next buyer will have just as good an experience or better.
